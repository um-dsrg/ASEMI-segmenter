# ASEMI Segmenter

The ASEMI Segmenter is a Python library for the automatic segmentation of
3D tomography images using machine learning.
The ASEMI Segmenter also contains a number of executable scripts implementing
various stages of the automatic segmentation process (such as volume
preprocessing, model training, and full-volume segmentation).

The software is the product of the [Automated SEgmentation of Microtomography
Imaging (ASEMI) project](https://www.um.edu.mt/projects/asemi/), led by
the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/) in partnership with the
[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility](http://www.esrf.eu/) (ESRF).
This project has [received
funding](https://attract-eu.com/selected-projects/automated-segmentation-of-microtomography-imaging-asemi/)
from the ATTRACT project funded by the EC under Grant Agreement 777222.

Documentation is available as follows:
- User documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/um-dsrg/ASEMI-segmenter/wiki).
   This includes a general introduction to segmentation and instructions for:
   - Installing the software
   - Preprocessing volumes, training models, and segmenting volumes
- Technical documentation is divided as follows:
   - High level technical documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/um-dsrg/ASEMI-segmenter/wiki).
   - A discussion of the algorithms used and results on four specimens can be found in our paper:
      [Automated segmentation of microtomography imaging of Egyptian mummies]()
   - Detailed documentation for the API is available in the code.
