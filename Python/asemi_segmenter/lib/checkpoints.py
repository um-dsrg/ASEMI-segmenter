'''
Module for the checkpoint manager.

A checkpoint is a point in command's process that can be skipped if it has already been reached
before. For example if a file is to be created but has already been created in a previous run
(which was interrupted) then it can be checkpointed so that its creation will be skipped in a
subsequent run.

A checkpoint is a dictionary where keys are unique names for checkpoints in a command's process
and values are the number of times that the checkpoint was reached. A checkpoint file is a JSON
encoded file consisting of a dictionary of checkpoints. The upper dictionary organises the
checkpoints into namespaces. The keys are the name of the namespace (usually command name) and
the values are checkpoint dictionaries.

        Create a new checkpoint manager.

        :param str namespace: A unique namespace for this checkpoint to use in the checkpoint file.
        :param str checkpoint_fullfname: The full file name (with path) of the checkpoint file. If
            None then the checkpoint state is not persisted.
        :param bool reset_checkpoint: Whether to clear the checkpoint from the file (if it
            exists) and start afresh.
        :param dict initial_content: The checkpoint data to initialise the checkpoint with.
            If the checkpoint file already contains data for this checkpoint, then a dictionary
            update will be made such that any keys in the file's checkpoint which are also in the
            initial_content will be overwritten, but nothing else. This is only the checkpoint
            for the command in question, not the entire checkpoint file content. In other words,
            only a single dictionary should be in initial_content, not 2 nested dictionaries.
            If None then the checkpoint will either be empty or the content of the checkpoint file if it exists. Can be used to reset the checkpoint of the command by passing in
            an empty dictionary.

        Apply a checkpoint for use in a with block.

        and at the end of the block will automatically save that the checkpoint was completed.
